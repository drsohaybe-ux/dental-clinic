"""recall_reminders: no-op, establishes an isolated branch.

This module has no tables — it's pure event glue (see CLAUDE.md). But
`removable=True` requires a self-contained Alembic branch even so:
`app/core/plugins/manifest_validator.py`'s `module_branch_is_isolated`
check is what makes `alembic downgrade recall_reminders@base` safe to
run on uninstall without touching any other module's migrations, and
that check needs at least one revision living under this module's own
`migrations/versions/` directory to have something to walk.

Standalone branch, no parent — there is nothing here to root on core
"0001" for, since there's no schema to create.

Revision ID: rr_0001

Create Date: 2026-08-18
