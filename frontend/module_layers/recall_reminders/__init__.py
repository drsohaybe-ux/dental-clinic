"""recall_reminders — connects the `recalls` module to the
`notifications` gateway.

`recalls` already publishes `EventType.RECALL_CREATED` but "never
sends" anything (by its own design — see its CLAUDE.md). `notifications`
already has a full delivery gateway but nothing calls it for recalls.
This module is pure glue: it has no models, no UI, no API surface of
its own — it just subscribes to one event and calls one existing
function.

Depends on `recalls`, `notifications` and `patients` (the handler reads
Patient for the template context) — ADR 0002 / 0003: legal cross-module
reads/calls because all three are declared.

Ships its own system-level email template
(`backend/templates/email/{locale}/recall_reminder.html`) — no setup
step required. The `notification_templates` table is a per-clinic
override, not the source (see NotificationService.get_template's
clinic-specific-then-system fallback).
