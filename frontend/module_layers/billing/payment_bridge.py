"""Budget ↔ invoice bridge (issue #178, ADR 0019).

Rule: *money allocated to a budget is money for that budget's invoices.*
Whenever a payment's allocations change (``payment.allocated``) or an
invoice is issued from a budget, billing reconciles its own
``invoice_payments`` rows so the invoice axis mirrors the allocation
axis — FIFO over the budget's open invoices, capped by each balance
due, inside the caller's transaction.

Everything here is idempotent: it compares the *objective* (Σ budget
allocations of the payment) with the *current* imputations and only
moves the difference. Payments allocated ``on_account`` are left alone
by design (ADR 0010) — they are the patient's credit until reassigned.
