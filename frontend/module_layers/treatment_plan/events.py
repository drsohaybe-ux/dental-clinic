"""Treatment plan module event handlers.

Listens to events from other modules and reacts accordingly.

Every handler here is **transactional** (ADR 0019): it declares ``db`` and
runs inside the publisher's session. The plan mirrors budget and agenda
state, so the two have to move together — on its own session a handler read
rows the publisher had only flushed (stale), competed for locks with it, and
committed changes the publisher could still roll back (issue #183).

A handler that publishes forwards its ``db`` so subscribers further down the
chain keep the same guarantee.
