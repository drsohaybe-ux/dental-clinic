"""Recalls module event subscribers.

Reacts to lifecycle events from ``patients``, ``agenda`` and
``treatment_plan``. All cross-module data is consumed via event
payloads — recalls never imports another module's models, except
``Patient`` (which is in ``manifest.depends``) for read-side queries.

Registered in :class:`~app.modules.recalls.RecallsModule.get_event_handlers`.

All state-changing handlers here are **transactional** (ADR 0019): they
declare ``db`` and run inside the publisher's session. A recall's link to an
appointment is an FK to ``appointments.id``, so an own-session handler cannot
even write it before the publisher commits — the row is invisible to a second
connection and the FK check fails (issue #183). Running in-tx also keeps the
recall's state and the appointment's state from diverging when one of them
rolls back.
