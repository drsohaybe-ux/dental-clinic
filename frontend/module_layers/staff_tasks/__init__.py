"""staff_tasks — the clinic's staff handoff board.

Internal tasks and handoff notes between staff members (front desk,
clinical, management): "call patient X back", "prepare implant kit for
room 2". Standalone — ``depends: []``. The only FKs outside its own
table point at core rows (clinics, users).

Status lifecycle: open → claimed → done, with cancelled as an escape
hatch (see service._VALID_TRANSITIONS). Claiming an unassigned task
assigns the claimer.
