"""activity_journal — append-only, event-driven staff activity log.

Pure listener on the event bus: subscribes to every EventType that is
published transactionally (all its publishers pass ``db=db``, audited
across app/) and writes one immutable row per occurrence inside the
publisher's transaction (ADR 0019). Writes only to its own table; the
schema is designed for the GDPR audit-trail work (#44) to build on.

Standalone module: depends on nothing. Staff-activity data is sensitive
(who did what), so ``role_permissions`` defaults to admin-only, like
expenses; clinics can widen it from the module admin UI.
